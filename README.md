## Hi, I am Madhav DhakalðŸŒ±
I am an Assistant Research Professor at Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute, Mississippi State University in Starkville, MS, USA. I joined this new role as a research faculty to develop a program on climate-smart agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions. My research cohort includes two PhD students, two student workers, and collaborative partners nationwide. Before joining MSU, I was a research scientist at the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania. At Rodale, I developed a soil health and weed management program in regenerative organic systems, published peer-reviewed research papers, and disseminated technology via webinars and training. That's why I am leading the MSU initiative on regenerative organic agriculture and overseeing the USDA certification process to kickoff organic systems research for the first time in the state. I led the USDA-ARS's Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Project from 2019 to 2021 in Stoneville, MS. My core and professional competencies include 
â€¢	Design statistically fit and objective-driven biological and environmental research
â€¢	Secure federal and state fundings, handle multiple research projects, and lead large team
